Languages Cheatsheet
===

This repository was created to serve as a quick reference for the programming languages included. The aim is to have useful commands and syntax for starting, creating, running, debugging and testing software with them.

Each language has the corresponding version to which the syntax and commands were tested, which means that it could not be fully operational for versions other than the one listed (be them older or newer).

It is not my intent to cover every aspect of the language, which would go against the purpose of being a quick reference project.
